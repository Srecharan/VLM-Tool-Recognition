Gas wrench,Gripping and turning pipes and fittings for gas and plumbing applications,"Adjust the jaw opening to match the pipe diameter; position the tool so that force applied to the handle tightens the jaw grip; use two wrenches when appropriate - one to hold, one to turn; apply force in a controlled manner","{'required_ppe': 'Work gloves, safety glasses, steel-toed boots', 'primary_hazards': 'Crushing injuries from heavy tool drops; pinch points between handle and nearby objects', 'common_misuses': 'Using on chrome or finished fixtures; using on nuts or bolts instead of pipes; extending handle for more leverage'}"
Hand,"Manipulating objects, tools, and materials with precision and dexterity",Use appropriate hand positions for the task; maintain proper ergonomic positioning to reduce strain; utilize multiple fingers for stability when handling objects; alternate hands for repetitive tasks when possible,"{'required_ppe': 'Task-appropriate gloves when necessary', 'primary_hazards': 'Cuts and abrasions from sharp materials; repetitive strain injuries', 'common_misuses': 'Using bare hands for tasks requiring protective equipment; exceeding physical limitations; placing hands near pinch points'}"
Needle-nose pliers,"Gripping, bending, and manipulating small wires and components in tight spaces",Grip the handles firmly; align the jaws parallel to the work piece; apply even pressure when gripping; use the tip for precise manipulation in confined spaces; avoid twisting the tool sideways,"{'required_ppe': 'Safety glasses, work gloves', 'primary_hazards': 'Pinch points between handles; sharp wire ends; eye injury from flying wire pieces', 'common_misuses': 'Using as a wrench; cutting hardened wire; applying excessive force to the tips'}"
Pliers,"Gripping, bending, and manipulating objects with enhanced leverage and control",Select appropriate size for the task; grip handles firmly; align jaws squarely with workpiece; apply even pressure when gripping; avoid twisting the tool sideways,"{'required_ppe': 'Safety glasses, work gloves', 'primary_hazards': 'Pinch points between handles; sharp edges; flying debris', 'common_misuses': 'Using as a wrench; applying excessive force; using damaged tools'}"
Cutting pliers,"Cutting wire, cables, and other materials with precision",Position material deep in jaws for maximum leverage; cut at right angles; apply steady pressure; keep cutting edges aligned; avoid cutting hardened materials,"{'required_ppe': 'Safety glasses, work gloves', 'primary_hazards': 'Flying cut pieces; sharp edges; pinch points', 'common_misuses': 'Cutting materials beyond capacity; using damaged cutting edges; twisting while cutting'}"
Tape measure,Taking accurate measurements of distances and dimensions,Extend tape carefully; hook end securely; keep tape straight for accuracy; use blade lock when needed; control retraction,"{'required_ppe': 'Safety glasses when retracting', 'primary_hazards': 'Cuts from tape edges; pinch hazards; tape snap-back', 'common_misuses': 'Overextending tape; uncontrolled retraction; using damaged tape'}"
Utility knife,Making precise cuts in various materials with replaceable blade,Ensure blade is sharp and locked; cut away from body; use straight edge when needed; retract blade after use; maintain steady pressure,"{'required_ppe': 'Cut-resistant gloves, safety glasses', 'primary_hazards': 'Severe cuts; blade breakage; accidental blade deployment', 'common_misuses': 'Using dull blades; cutting toward body; leaving blade extended'}"
Calipers,Taking precise measurements of internal and external dimensions,Zero instrument before use; maintain consistent pressure; keep measuring surfaces clean; use appropriate jaws for measurement type,"{'required_ppe': 'None required for standard use', 'primary_hazards': 'Sharp measuring points; pinch points between jaws', 'common_misuses': 'Dropping instrument; using excessive force; not zeroing before use'}"
Backsaw,"Making precise, straight cuts in wood with reinforced blade",Mark cutting line clearly; start cut with light strokes; maintain consistent angle; let saw do the work; support workpiece properly,"{'required_ppe': 'Safety glasses, dust mask', 'primary_hazards': 'Cuts from sharp teeth; wood splinters; dust inhalation', 'common_misuses': 'Forcing the cut; not supporting work; using for rough cutting'}"
